## Voice and tone

- Conversational and direct, mixing first-person experience with second-person guidance.
- Playful, witty, and candid; uses light sarcasm and humor without losing clarity.
- Confident but fair: highlights tradeoffs, not just hype.
- Uses vivid analogies and quick asides to keep energy up.

## Structure and flow

- Hook first: a short story, a real-world pain point, or a provocative question.
- Clear framing: "what this piece answers" before diving into details.
- Chunked sections with H2/H3 headings and short paragraphs.
- Interleaves practical advice with narrative commentary.
- Closes with a short wrap-up, takeaway list, or a nudge to the reader.

## Content habits
